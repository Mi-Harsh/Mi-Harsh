# 👋 Hi, I'm Harsh Palande!

I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student at PCCOER, passionate about **AI, ML, and Data Science**. I've worked on several end-to-end machine learning projects, web applications, and cloud-based deployments. My career goal is to become an AI engineer contributing to top research teams like Google DeepMind, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, etc., while also working on cutting-edge innovations.

### 🔭 Current Focus
- **Machine Learning:** Implementing my ML and Data Science knowledge through projects, Kaggle competitions, and more.
- **Cloud Technologies:** Developing and deploying ML models on AWS and exploring cloud solutions.
- **Data Science:** Mastering data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced analytics.
- **Core Engineering:** Strengthening concepts in DSA, Object-Oriented Programming, computer networks, and security.

### 🚀 Projects
Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:
- **[Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/Mi-Harsh/bostonhousepricing)**: End-to-end ML project using XGBoost, deployed on AWS with a Flask web app.
- **[Fake News Detection](https://github.com/Mi-Harsh/ML-Mini-Projects)**: Built a model using NLTK, TF-IDF, and Porter Stemmer to detect fake news.
- **[Object Detection App](https://github.com/Harsh-Palande/object-detection-app)**: Created an Android application using TensorFlow Lite and Google ML Kit for image-based object detection.
- **Automated Student Placement Dashboard**: A web-based tool to automate job applications and manage resumes for students (link coming soon).
- **Drug Inventory and Supply Chain Tracking System**: A system using Hyperledger Fabric and Machine Learning to streamline drug distribution with real-time tracking, prediction models, and blockchain security (team project, work in progress).

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- **Advanced Machine Learning** techniques to enhance model performance and explore real-world applications.
- Exploring **Cloud Solutions** and DevOps tools for automated deployments.
- Strengthening my **DSA** skills for competitive programming.

### 🔍 Areas I’m Exploring
I’m eager to dive deeper into:
- Diving deeper into **Deep Learning** with a focus on **NLP**, **Computer Vision**, and **TensorFlow**.
- Exploring more aspects of **AI** for **automation**, **IoT**, and **robotics**.
- Learning how **AI** can transform industries through **smart automation** and **intelligent systems**.

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I find the intersection of technology and creativity fascinating – from building AI models to sketching out an Iron Man suit's full design, I enjoy merging these two worlds!
